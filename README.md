# School_District_Analysis

### Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to help Maria and her supervisor look through the data from the students_complete.csv file because they are seeing academic dishonesty for the reading and math grades for Thomas High School nineth graders. We are to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact and then write up a report to describe the changes we see from the data that has been updated.



## Results:

- The district summary was affected by changes in the average math, reading and overall passing percentage by 2% less than the original dataset.

- The school summary is affected because the averages all go up the moment you adjust the 9th grade scores by a good amount and seems to bring up the percentages a good amount        nearly 25%.

- When I replaced the 9th graders scores you can see in the picture above that it greatly affects the outcomes since it subjectivly 1/4 the score total for that school.
- Replacing these scores affected:
    - Math and Reading scores by making it more even to calculate and to be able to see where the values are changing which would indicate where the dishonesty would be.
    - Scores by school spending was not greatly affected so you are able to consider this not much of a change.
    - The scores by school size was also not greatly affected and the data shows that this change is not big enough to make much of a change.
    - Scores by school type have only changed by .01 or so which also would make this change not great enough to consider this a major change of information.
## Summary

  When looking at this dataset what we confirm is when taking out the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School we have a greater increase in overall passing as well as Math and      Reading. I did notice that the school count is also affected from 1635 to 1174. The other changes we notice such as the minute changes in the scores by school, spending and type show that even with the change 9th grade taken out that this data is accurate when looking at it and that the dishonesty most likely was within the 9th grade scores data.
