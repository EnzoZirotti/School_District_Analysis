# School_District_Analysis

### Overview of the school district analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to help Maria and her supervisor look through the data from the students_complete.csv file because they are seeing academic dishonesty for the reading and math grades for Thomas High School nineth graders. We are to replace the math and reading scores with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact and then write up a report to describe the changes we see from the data that has been updated.



##Results:
  -The district summary was affected by changes in the average math, reading and overall passing percentage by 2% more than the original dataset.
